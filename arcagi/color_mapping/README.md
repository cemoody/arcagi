## Experiments

### ex16.py - Optimized Memorization with Sinusoidal Position Embeddings
- Same architecture as ex15.py but with parameter-free position encodings
- **Sinusoidal Position Embeddings**: Uses Transformer-style sinusoidal encoding:
  - No learnable parameters for positions (saves 460,800 parameters)
  - Applies sin/cos functions with different frequencies to x and y coordinates
  - First half of dimensions encode x-position, second half encode y-position
- **Binary Noise Regularization**: Adds training-time noise for robustness:
  - 5% probability of flipping binary features (0↔1) during training
  - Small Gaussian noise (σ=0.01) for continuous features
  - Only active during training, disabled during evaluation
  - Controllable via `--noise_prob` argument (default: 0.05)
- **Per-Index Accuracy Tracking**: Detailed performance monitoring:
  - Tracks accuracy separately for each example index within files
  - Shows input vs output accuracy for each index
  - Reports whether both input and output achieve perfect accuracy
  - Helps identify which specific examples are challenging
- **Colored Terminal Visualization**: Uses `terminal_imshow` for better readability:
  - Color-coded grid display instead of plain numbers
  - Shows background (-1) as empty spaces
  - Includes colored legend for easy interpretation
  - Much easier to spot differences between predicted and ground truth
- **Single-File Mode**: Train/test split within same file:
  - Train on 'train' subset, evaluate on 'test' subset
  - Useful for understanding generalization within file patterns
  - Separate test evaluation with detailed metrics
- Benefits:
  - Reduces overfitting by removing learnable position parameters
  - Provides smooth interpolation between positions
  - Should generalize better to unseen spatial patterns
  - More robust training with noise regularization
  - Better visibility into model performance per example
- **Results**: Near-perfect input accuracy (~99.7%) 
  - Sinusoidal embeddings may cause less stable training compared to learned embeddings
  - While parameter-free, they may not adapt as well to spatial patterns in this task

**Training Progress on `28e73c20` (single-file mode, 100 epochs):**
- **Input accuracy**: ~99.7% - Model learns input patterns very well
- **Training behavior**: Unstable, oscillates between predicting all zeros or all threes
- **Parameter reduction**: ~460k fewer parameters compared to ex15.py (learned embeddings)
- **Key insight**: Sinusoidal embeddings, while parameter-free and theoretically better for generalization, may not be optimal for this specific memorization task where learned position embeddings can better adapt to the spatial patterns in the training data

21. **Hybrid architectures show promise**: Combining complementary approaches (NCA + Message Passing) may achieve best of both worlds
22. **Adaptive processing is valuable**: Models that can switch between different processing modes based on need show great potential
23. **Two-phase processing**: Noise for robustness learning, then clean convergence, improves training stability and final performance
24. **Sequential vs adaptive hybrids**: Direct sequential combination (ex25: 100%) dramatically outperforms adaptive switching (ex24: 23.2%) - simplicity wins over complexity
25. **Architectural inheritance works**: Successfully combining proven components (ex21 MP + ex23 NCA) without complex integration overhead achieved perfect performance
26. **Processing guarantees matter**: Sequential design ensures both paradigms contribute to every step vs uncertain mode selection in adaptive approaches
27. **Perfect test accuracy is achievable**: ex25.py demonstrates that 100% generalization is possible with proper architectural design and train/test methodology
