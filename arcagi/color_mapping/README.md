## Experiments

### ex16.py - Optimized Memorization with Sinusoidal Position Embeddings
- Same architecture as ex15.py but with parameter-free position encodings
- **Sinusoidal Position Embeddings**: Uses Transformer-style sinusoidal encoding:
  - No learnable parameters for positions (saves 460,800 parameters)
  - Applies sin/cos functions with different frequencies to x and y coordinates
  - First half of dimensions encode x-position, second half encode y-position
- **Binary Noise Regularization**: Adds training-time noise for robustness:
  - 5% probability of flipping binary features (0↔1) during training
  - Small Gaussian noise (σ=0.01) for continuous features
  - Only active during training, disabled during evaluation
  - Controllable via `--noise_prob` argument (default: 0.05)
- **Per-Index Accuracy Tracking**: Detailed performance monitoring:
  - Tracks accuracy separately for each example index within files
  - Shows input vs output accuracy for each index
  - Reports whether both input and output achieve perfect accuracy
  - Helps identify which specific examples are challenging
- **Colored Terminal Visualization**: Uses `terminal_imshow` for better readability:
  - Color-coded grid display instead of plain numbers
  - Shows background (-1) as empty spaces
  - Includes colored legend for easy interpretation
  - Much easier to spot differences between predicted and ground truth
- **Single-File Mode**: Train/test split within same file:
  - Train on 'train' subset, evaluate on 'test' subset
  - Useful for understanding generalization within file patterns
  - Separate test evaluation with detailed metrics
- Benefits:
  - Reduces overfitting by removing learnable position parameters
  - Provides smooth interpolation between positions
  - Should generalize better to unseen spatial patterns
  - More robust training with noise regularization
  - Better visibility into model performance per example
- **Results**: Near-perfect input accuracy (~99.7%) 
  - Sinusoidal embeddings may cause less stable training compared to learned embeddings
  - While parameter-free, they may not adapt as well to spatial patterns in this task

**Training Progress on `28e73c20` (single-file mode, 100 epochs):**
- **Input accuracy**: ~99.7% - Model learns input patterns very well
- **Training behavior**: Unstable, oscillates between predicting all zeros or all threes
- **Parameter reduction**: ~460k fewer parameters compared to ex15.py (learned embeddings)
- **Key insight**: Sinusoidal embeddings, while parameter-free and theoretically better for generalization, may not be optimal for this specific memorization task where learned position embeddings can better adapt to the spatial patterns in the training data

## Key Insights

1. **Color constraints are crucial**: Limiting predictions to colors present in the input significantly improves accuracy
2. **Spatial consistency matters**: Message passing between neighboring pixels helps maintain coherent predictions
3. **Example-specific features help**: Adding learnable embeddings per training example aids memorization
4. **More message passing rounds improve accuracy**: 12 rounds (ex14) performed better than 2-6 rounds
5. **Aggressive learning rates work well**: Higher learning rates (0.05-0.1) with proper scheduling achieve faster convergence
6. **Some files need more epochs**: While most files converge in ~40-50 epochs, some require 150+ epochs for perfect accuracy
